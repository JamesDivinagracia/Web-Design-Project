# Web-Design-Project

https://github.com/JamesDivinagracia/Web-Design-Project/edit/main/README.md


This project is for my college. It's a "Nutrition website aimed at children".

This final project will give me 70% of my overall Web Design grade. I should be able to:
- Design the website to be easily understandable to children
- Develop the code for the html of the website including the css or java and any web tools (optional)
- It should teach children the nutritional values of foods in a simple and concise way, such as minigames. 
  - It should teach children why vegetables and a balanced diet is neccessary for their growth.
  - Easy recipies while being fun to make could be used as an example of a nutritous meal.
- It has a video that uses almost an entirety of the website so the need for scrolling is minimal.
- It should have a cooking minigame  that seamlessly begins after a part of the educational video stops. 
- Lastly, I should make ways to make this easily read the code for any future planning or bug fixes
