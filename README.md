# Web-Design-Project

https://github.com/JamesDivinagracia/Web-Design-Project/edit/main/README.md


This project is for my college. It's a "Nutrition website aimed at children".

This final project will give me 70% of my overall Web Design grade. I should be able to:
- Design the website to be easily understandable to children
- Develop the code for the html of the website including the css or java and any web tools (optional)
- It should teach children the nutritional values of foods in a simple and concise way, such as minigames. 
  - It should teach children why vegetables and a balanced diet is neccessary for their growth.
  - Easy recipies while being fun to make could be used as an example of a nutritous meal.
- It has a video that uses almost an entirety of the website so the need for scrolling is minimal.
- It should have a cooking minigame  that seamlessly begins after a part of the educational video stops. 
- Lastly, I should make ways to make this easily read the code for any future planning or bug fixes

Canva is a free online design and publishing tool, I am using it due to its simple editing software akin to a Microsoft Powerpoint that has slides for every web page.

Here's the Irish link for copyright. To combat copyright I'll be using open source software or create designs from scratch, all the software used 
would be mentioned in a "credits" page which is located in the footer.
